            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <small>Machine learning implementation involves leveraging algorithms to enable systems to learn from data
                and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. It begins with data collection,
                preprocessing, and feature engineering, followed by model selection, training, and evaluation. Python
                libraries like TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and PyTorch facilitate this process. Implementation spans
                various domains such as healthcare, finance, e-commerce, and more, addressing diverse challenges like
                fraud detection, personalized recommendations, and predictive maintenance. </small>

                implemented the algorithms within Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and validation. On the frontend,
                I employed Django to create a user-friendly interface, integrating HTML and CSS to design a visually
